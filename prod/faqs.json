    "question": "Will I get banned by Blizzard, if I use W3Champions ladder?",

    "question": "Are there any plans to add 2v2, 4v4, or FFA ladder?",
    "answer": "Yes, we support 2v2 (AT and RT), 4v4 (RT), as well as FFA. There are no current plans to support 4v4 (AT) or 3v3"

    "question": "Is the queue global or do I just queue up with players of my region?",
    "answer": "The queue is restricted to the gateway you logged in on (Europe/America/Asia/)"
  },
  {

  {
    "question": "I started the Queue but I don't find matches, what can I do?",
    "answer": "The matchmaking widens the search the longer you are searching for, so do not restart queuing. If it's a unpopular time, try again later. If you are sure, it must be a bug, reach out to us."

    "question": "Will we get Rank-Titles like in SC2?",
    "answer": "We have not yet decided. For now the ladder will work close to the classic Warcraft III ladder."
  },
  {
    "question": "I get the message \"Joining ladder game, please wait...\" but nothing happens. What to do?",
    "answer": "This is currently a well known bug. We will investigate it. Please be patient and wait for game to start. An automated 10 minute timeout will occur if you restart Warcraft III via Alt+F4 during game creation to prevent a possible exploit. We have recently pushed some changes which should reduce this issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will ladder still work after Blizzard patches wc3?",
