  {
    "question": "I get the message \"Joining ladder game, please wait...\" but nothing happens. What to do?",
    "answer": "This is currently a well known bug. We will investigate it. Please be patient and wait for game to start. An automated 10 minute timeout will occur if you restart Warcraft III via Alt+F4 during game creation to prevent a possible exploit. We have recently pushed some changes which should reduce this issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will ladder still work after Blizzard patches wc3?",
